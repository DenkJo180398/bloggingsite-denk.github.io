<p><strong>Young Employees</strong></p>
<p>How is the situation about employment for our younger generation especially in Austria?</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, more and more attention is paid to the unemployed younger generation so that they can find a job. But through the covid pandemic the numbers have not decreased because young people are usually the first to be terminated when the staff is getting cut.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the willing to work hard and the motivation of the youth is decreasing through the time. Because of that it´s very important for everyone themselves to find something to work for, what makes them happy. And what they can imagine doing for a lifetime. As a reason it´s important that the youth gets to know what possibilities they have in their life. Also, that they have to decide this and need to work hard for their goals.</p>
<p>After all, enough people are always wanted anyway. Big companies search always for new trainees. (Lehrlinge) In addition, technicians are needed more and more in this technological age. Manual jobs are becoming increasingly unpopular, so you are welcomed with open hands as a manual worker. But for example, if you graduate in an HTL as an IT-technician you get in average five job offers from companies. So, you don´t have to care about that.</p>
<p>Concluding I have to say, if you have a few interests in life and you are motivated to work, you´ll have no problem in searching for a job or an apprenticeship (Lehrstelle).</p>
